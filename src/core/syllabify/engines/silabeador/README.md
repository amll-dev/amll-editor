# Silabeador (Pyodide Port)

This is a port of the [Silabeador](https://github.com/fsanzl/silabeador) Python library using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) for **automatic Spanish syllable splitting** in the browser.

Some minor changes have been made to the original Python code to improve integration with Pyodide.
